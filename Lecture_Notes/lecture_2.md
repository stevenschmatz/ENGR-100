### Binary recap

Binary numbers can be unsigned or signed. Without prior knowledge of the signedness of the number, you can have no idea what the number actually is.

### Truth tables

When a small number of outputs, it is a very powerful and useful tool. However, the number of rows increases exponentially:

$$\text{rows}(n) = 2^n$$

Hence, for 30 rows, there are around a billion entries.
