ENGR 100-250
============

These are my notes for the introductory computer engineering class [ENGR 100-250](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pmchen/engr100/) at the University of Michigan.

This class is centered around a single project, which involves computer engineering principles and technical communication skills. This book will cover both areas of knowledge.

Project examples
----------------
* Nerf machine gun that uses image recognition software to detect humans, and then consequently shoot them
* A Pokemon clone
* Atari breakout, where the position of the paddle is controlled by the user's voice pitch

The project must be built on top of a FPGA using the Verilog HDL.

Purpose
-------

This book is a central repository of notes for me, but please use it to study yourself further on.
